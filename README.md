# Foreground Counter Feature
Welcome to the Foreground Counter Feature repository! This project showcases a simple yet robust foreground service in an Android application that counts upwards continuously, even if the app is closed or removed from the background. The counting is controlled via two buttons: Start and Stop.




## Features
- Foreground Service: The counting is managed by a foreground service, ensuring that the count continues even when the app is not actively running.
- Persistent Notification: When the counting starts, a persistent notification is displayed, showing the current count.
- User Control: The user can start and stop the counting using dedicated buttons within the app.


## How It Works

### Start Counting
- Click the Start button.
- A notification appears with the current count.
- The counter continues to increment every second, regardless of whether the app is in the foreground, background, or closed.

### Stop Counting
- Click the Stop button.
- The counting stops, and the notification is dismissed.
